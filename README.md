# OSSINTT

OSINT Framework is a cybersecurity framework that includes a set of OSINT 
technologies to make gathering intelligence and data easier. 
Security researchers and penetration testers mostly utilise this 
programme for digital footprinting, OSINT research, intelligence collecting, and reconnaissance.

OSINTT is just like OSINT Framework but have some differences which are: 

-> It is written in bash.
-> Auto update and Upgrade features.
-> Easy to understand code.
-> Auto download any repository(s). 
-> Free move around. 
-> Auto forwarding to gooogle.
